# Resume Website

This is a simple, responsive single-page resume website. Edit `index.html` and `style.css` to personalise with your information.

## Local development

No build step is required. Simply open `index.html` in your browser to preview your changes.

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that deploys the site to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. In your GitHub repository, navigate to **Settings → Pages**.
3. In the **Build and deployment** section, choose **GitHub Actions** as the source.
4. Save the settings.
5. Commit and push any change to `main`—the site will be built and published automatically.

Your resume will be available at:

```
https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/
```

Replace `<your-username>` and `<repository-name>` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.
